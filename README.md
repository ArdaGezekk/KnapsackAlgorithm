# KnapsackAlgorithm

The Knapsack algorithm is an algorithm based on getting the most optimal efficiency from the available data.
To give a simple example, imagine a thief who can put items up to a certain weight in his backpack (knapsack). 
At home, things have weights and values, the thief should leave the house with snow in the most optimal way and fill his bag accordingly.
